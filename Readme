Introduction:
YouTube has over 2.5 billion monthly active users, making it the second largest social media/entertainment platform in the world after Facebook. Users upload over 500 hours of video content on YouTube every minute, providing a vast amount of information to analyze. Analyzing user behavior on certain YouTube channels (such as likes, comments, tags, and video titles) can provide insights into how viewers perceive the content and what changes can be made to improve it. During the COVID-19 pandemic, YouTube viewing traffic increased significantly due to restrictions forcing people to stay at home. The extended viewing time generated a large user base and revenue, motivating many people to pursue YouTube as a career option.

Problem Statement
Sentiment analysis is crucial for understanding user engagement on YouTube
YouTube is a significant source of user-generated content and opinions
Analyzing the sentiment of YouTube comments can be challenging due to the large amount of data
Manual research can be time-consuming and inefficient
Determining the sentiment of comments that use sarcasm or irony can be difficult
An automated system is needed to efficiently and accurately analyze the sentiment of YouTube comments
Such a system would enable researchers to gather valuable insights into public opinion and user engagement on the platform
Data-driven decisions and effective strategies can be developed based on these insights
