Loopmancer is one difficult but exactly fun Game, & not only with it's \"Death, Revive, Repeat\" death loop theme to the game, but that it's also one incredible Cyberpunk themed setting they're going with in this game.\n\nAlso, the Protagonist's, Xiang Zixu's, Voice Actor sounds familiar too. I'm not sure who's voicing him, but so far all I can think of who's voicing Zixu is either Matthew Mercer or Troy Baker or neither one. Whoever's voicing him did an amazing job in voicing him. Same goes for the other Voice Cast in this game as well.\n\nNow that I witness you play Loopmancer, I hope you plan on continuing this game at some point! And by the way, I have somewhat & has finally caught up to you on your current Walkthrough on your Channel. Not sure which Walkthrough you're doing now, but whatever game you'll be playing on here, I wish you Good Luck on you're latest & current & even your future upcoming Video Game Playthrough on your Channel, man. If you're not going to continue in doing a full Playthrough/Gameplay/Walkthrough of Loopmancer, then I might end up searching for someone online who has started & already finished this game on their Channel.\n\nAnyways, I think this first long part of your Loopmancer Playthrough/Gameplay/Walkthrough is epic & amazing. Especially with the graphics it has. I really did enjoy every the story plot, unexpected moments, the awesome theme to it, and the action pact combat this game has to offer.

A true egomaniac who literally went insane. It\u2019s almost justice that he got to spend a thousand years as a freakish, cancer-ridden mutant abomination, trapped alone in his bunker, especially after not just the suffering he indirectly inflicted with the Faro Plague and deleting APOLLO, but the suffering he directly caused, murdering the Alphas, murdering those he had in his bunker\u2026\n\nI actually like that they don\u2019t show him in his disgusting, mutant glory.

You could easily have 10-15 different drivers lead a lap in NASCAR, which is almost unheard of in F1 (usually 1-3).\n\nIn fact of the 12 F1 races this year, there have been only 2 have had more than two lap leaders, one for 2 laps and one for 4 laps. There have been 4 races this year where Max Verstappen was the only person to lead a lap (he started and finished in first), and only one other driver has won a race, his teammate in the exact same car, Sergio Perez.\n\nI don\u2019t watch it anymore but NASCAR seems a lot more sensible when you think about the relative differences. Just like F1 the tiniest bit of steering input can shave tenths off or add them to a lap, something that is just as detrimental in NASCAR as F1. When you think of it as \u2018just going in circles\u201d, it doesn\u2019t really do justice to the tight groups, high speed, low margin for error, and competitive setting.\n\nNASCAR is also ass in person, I mean complete and total cheeks. It\u2019s loud af, you can\u2019t see anything, and what you can see is on the other side of a 2-3 mile oval so you can barely tell what\u2019s going on.\n\nIf you want to watch racing: DTM, Super GT, FIA Endurance, or Rallycross are the only racing that\u2019s good anymore, other than drags.

Aloy then overrides a Charger and mounted it and rode to Barren Light. At  Barren Light Aloy has to Convince a guard called Lawan to lead her to speak to Commander Nozar  for the Gates to be Opened for her to enter in to the West but Commander Nozar proved stubborn and refused Aloy entrance, Aloy ignored the Commander and asked for the Gates to be Opened and she finally succeeded with the help of Erend. Varl joined Aloy at Barren Light and they passed throught the gates to the West.\n\nThere is one more obstacle on Aloy's path and that is the Tenakth tribe,who ordered Aloy not to cross the border between the East and West or she will be killed, but thankfully the Tenakth tribe's Marshal  respected Aloy's and recognized her as the Savior of the Meridian and granted her right of passage into the West.He gave Aloy a special Dagger as a symbol of Right passage to the West.

That's an astute observation.  Many games don't, but for the many games that do, the dark is a helpful thing to do because usually the player has no idea where they're headed at the beginning, so beginning in a dark area greatly assists developer tricks like using light to unconsciously guide the player.  Devs use subconscious guidance like this all. the. time. because we humans are drawn toward light.  Think of walking through a dark area and seeing a campfire.  You're naturally going to want to approach it.  You're drawn to light.\n\nNotice at 5:02 you exit the building, then despite being able to see just fine, the path is lined with lights, the doorway you need to pass theough is brightly lit (an attractive destination,) then when you go through the door, the porch up ahead is marked with a lantern and you can see light through the windows.\n\nStarting a game in a dark area, or on a dark and rainy night can also unconsciously symbolize unease and strife in the protagonists current situation.

This game was developed due to a love for martial arts films, and though it has a few game inspirations, it mostly draws from a long list of films on that front.\n\nHere are some of the film inspirations Sloclap had while developing Sifu:\n\n\u00d7 Kill Bill\n\u00d7 The Raid\n\u00d7 Oldboy\n\u00d7 The Protector\n\u00d7 Kill Zone\n\u00d7 John Wick\n\u00d7 Ip Man\n\u00d7 Lady Snowblood\n\u00d7 Multiple Bruce Lee films\n\u00d7 Multiple Jackie Chan films\n\nSome of these are minor and others are major. An example would be that the story has obvious similarities to Kill Bill. Everything from being left for dead by essentially an assassination squad lead by a leader to hunting down each one individually.\n\nThe Squats level is a definite homage to The Raid and the hallway segment of that level is paying homage to Oldboy.\n\nIf anyone hasn't seen a lot of these movies and you enjoy Sifu, I recommend you watch them asap. Play through Sifu again after that and you'll notice lots of little things and you'll have a newfound appreciation for the game.\n\nAll I can say is that Sloclap deserves a slow clap from all of us. This game is amazing and I hope they do more with this IP; whether that be DLC or even a sequel in a couple years.

Good Game! Best Game of 2021 ever played, as well as ever watched! Really enjoyed all the action & story behind each of the characters in Call of Duty: Vanguard! Shame that both Novak & Richard had to be killed off in this game with Novak being the only character you play once as a form of tutorial character during the start of this game. Then again, on the cover & appearance of picture for this game, there are only the 4 playable characters, Arthur, Polina, Wade & Lucas, shown of which you play as in the campaign, so that makes sense.\n\nI like the unique play style for each of the characters you play as throughout the game in their respective backstories. Definitely makes it more enjoyable, challenging, experiencing and most of all fun to play a Call of Duty game in which you play as multiple characters from their own countries! I know this was a thing in the old Call of Duty games, but this new one is much more fun the its predecessors. And the final Level/Story Campaign really shows how incredible of a game in seeing how the remain four Vanguard Soldiers actually cooperate without getting at each others throats just cause they are not from the same country. Equality is what this game showed us as the 4 of them are on the same side & have one common enemy while both surviving & fighting together!\n\nStill behind, as always, but I'm getting there.

Best Far Cry Game up to boot since 2021 when it first got released. FINALLY, I'm at the final part of watching your Far Cry 6 Playthrough & I enjoyed it! There were some sad moments, but there were also some good & awesomely incredible moments & events that happened in Far Cry 6. Especially with how you reacted while playing this game & the Easter Eggs this game had to offer. Loved it all the same.\r\n\r\nI may not remember all of what was shown in past parts, but I do know that there were some losses on the Good Side with the characters that Dani has encountered throughout her journey this game. Esperanza loses her father, Carlos by bomb explosion, Yelena & the Legends of the '67 Revolution loose both Jonron & El Tigre by Viviro Poisoning, & both Dani & Juan loses Clara at the hands of Anton himself. Talia, Paolo & Bicho are the only ones who didn't loose anybody aside for one of them nearly getting killed of course. But in the end, those 3 survived on their part of their arc. Now that ending was both upsetting yet awesome. Though Anton only killed himself as his way of giving up, but Diego? That's the most sadden moment in seeing him being killed off by his on father. Reason for it or not, that's the most tragic of all in this game.\r\n\r\nThat Epilogue dialogue after the credits. Juan talking to one of the Smugglers with the Viviro Shipment...and I'm 100% sure that is Vaas from Far Cry 3 that Juan was talking to. Can't believe he made a Voice Cameo in the Post-Credit Ending. But it's also a foreshadow for the first DLC of Far Cry 6 in which you play as the Villains & learning of each of their Arcs that has either sets off or shows what has happened to them after the end of the Far Cry games they appeared in. While I do wish to watch your Far Cry 6 DLC Playthroughs of the 3 Villains of the past Far Cry Games originally, but due to you not uploading the Joseph Seed DLC Playthrough on your Channel after the Pagan DLC I won't be seeing your DLC walkthroughs of them. My apologies. I hope you understand that, Brad. But if you DO come back to this & will do the Joseph Seed DLC, then I will come back to see the Vaas & Pagan DLC Gameplays you have already played before. For now, no watching of those two unless you do Joseph's. Lol.\r\n\r\nIncredible & Amazing Far Cry 6 Walkthrough/Gameplay/Playthrough, Brad. I'm still behind, but I do know that I'll eventually catch up to your recent Playthrough that I'm interested in that you're on. But ONLY if it's a game I'm into or that it interest me.
