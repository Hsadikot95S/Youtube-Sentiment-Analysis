This is some awesome epic Roguelite Roguelike game that I even seen. Loopmancer is one difficult but exactly fun Game, & not only with it's \"Death, Revive, Repeat\" death loop theme to the game, but that it's also one incredible Cyberpunk themed setting they're going with in this game.\n\nAlso, the Protagonist's, Xiang Zixu's, Voice Actor sounds familiar too. I'm not sure who's voicing him, but so far all I can think of who's voicing Zixu is either Matthew Mercer or Troy Baker or neither one. Whoever's voicing him did an amazing job in voicing him. Same goes for the other Voice Cast in this game as well.\n\nNow that I witness you play Loopmancer, I hope you plan on continuing this game at some point! And by the way, I have somewhat & has finally caught up to you on your current Walkthrough on your Channel. Not sure which Walkthrough you're doing now, but whatever game you'll be playing on here, I wish you Good Luck on you're latest & current & even your future upcoming Video Game Playthrough on your Channel, man. If you're not going to continue in doing a full Playthrough/Gameplay/Walkthrough of Loopmancer, then I might end up searching for someone online who has started & already finished this game on their Channel.\n\nAnyways, I think this first long part of your Loopmancer Playthrough/Gameplay/Walkthrough is epic & amazing. Especially with the graphics it has. I really did enjoy every the story plot, unexpected moments, the awesome theme to it, and the action pact combat this game has to offer.

I understand why the character you are with will shout Get Down but the text prompt as well is a joke.  that is what I mean when I point out that the games were designed to hold your hand.   I have  played the second Red Dead Redemption  6 times.

(SPOLIERS AHEAD) \nSo, Silas bit Caleb who then infected his dad (Chris) and his sister (Callie). Leading Caleb to run away. Silas also left which led to the Hackett family setting up the camera and the safety boxes to catch him in case Silas came back. Since sliver bullets kill they wanted to kill Silas leaving everyone in the family uninfected. However, the idea from Eliza flashback is the Hacketts set fire to the show which essentially let Silas out and it was all their fault that her son was gone. Now, Silas doesn\u2019t resurface til the night before camp started when Max and Laura almost hit him. They get kidnapped by Travis whose protecting his family. By end of summer, Chris has bitten Max, who bit Laura(I think it could have been kaylee but I\u2019m not sure), who bit Ryan so he didn\u2019t die. Yet, who bit Nick is unclear however is most likely that it was Caleb because Ryan saw the white wolf (Silas) by the Cabins last. Nick was bit in the forest closer to the island I think. Kaylee is dead because Laura killed her in hopes she was Chris. Bobby, Papa Hackett and Mama Hackett are also dead due to Brad\u2019s choices (I\u2019m okay with these deaths except for Bobby because he was helping the kids and seemed like he was just scared of getting in trouble for not protecting the family.) Now knowing all that the only Hacketts alive are Travis (not infected) and Caleb (infected) but Eliza think the whole family should die for what they did which is why you get her flashback without the choice. However it\u2019s hard to not feel sympathy for the Hacketts learning the hierarchy of the bites. Also we aren\u2019t even sure if the Hacketts were responsible for the fire of Eliza show. Dylan is missing a hand so he didn\u2019t turn when he got bit but other than that everyone else (Kaitlin,Abigail,Emma,Jacob) should be in one piece. But, we also haven\u2019t seen Jacob since Ryan let him out of the cage. Now there are three infected left (Silas,Caleb,Nick). In thinking there was an infected in a cage in the Hacketts house and Dylan and Kaitlin trapped one under the car. The last one should be by the cabins where the radio station was. Also I think it was smart for Max to stay because he probably would of died and then killing Chris would of been pointless. The final choice has to be picking a side (Hacketts or Eliza)(Save Caleb or Silas).\n\nAll in all excited to see how this ends and I\u2019ve been a fan of Brad since back when he played Mirrors Edge haven\u2019t stop watching since.", "date": "2022-06-18", "polarity_vader": -0.9955}, {"comment": "thats not a game thats a movie", "date": "2022-06-18", "polarity_vader": 0.0}, {"comment": "Stay stay stay stay", "date": "2022-06-18", "polarity_vader": 0.0}, {"comment": "Maybe you can't get all cards because if the different paths you take?", "date": "2022-06-18", "polarity_vader": 0.0}, {"comment": "I don't know the outcome if Max were to stay or leave but I'm glad you stayed, I remembered Jason or Justin looking at the notes and it saying \"No swimming\" and \"Only travel by boat\"", "date": "2022-06-18", "polarity_vader": 0.5994}, {"comment": "Rad has actually become more observant and making smart choices.

There is a method to swerving, what you do is turn your wheel one full turn in one direction then half a turn in the opposite direction then another half a turn in the same direction and finally half a turn in the opposite direction.\nExample:\n 1 full turn to the left \n 1/2 turn to the right \n 1/2 turn to the right again \n 1/2 turn to the left \nMake sure you start slow and only increase speed as you gain proficiency, also be sure to practice swerving to both the left and the right.

It's a good game, but there are some pretty glaring problems. Like there are plenty of moments where your play is interrupted by a cutscene for the characters to have a conversation. Dialog which should have been happening while you were walking around, but it needs to happen in a cutscene to facilitate the \"movie mode\" which is just cutscenes. That makes the game a little frustrating and slow. While the first game was a literal game with cinematics on top, this is a prolonged cinematic with some game on top. Movie mode seems to be the preferred and even recommended mode of play for this game because it seems to have been prioritized in the development.

It was, to my mind, just one of the best examples of where a film maker has a vision and realises it, without any input from domineering film companies. Although the horror is a bit dated - it relied on a fear of unknown cultures, and archaic rituals etc. that characterised that period of British life - it made me realise that to be genuinely scary, a film can't just rely on cheap jumpscares. It is genuinely one of my favourite films full stop.", "date": "2022-06-12", "polarity_vader": -0.8689}, {"comment": "My fav is Anabel, made me cry like a baby\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude02", "date": "2022-06-12", "polarity_vader": 0.296}, {"comment": "Lol Brad has a good taste, the old \"the thing\" movie is the best still.", "date": "2022-06-12", "polarity_vader": 0.872}, {"comment": "2:00 OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH", "date": "2022-06-12", "polarity_vader": 0.0}, {"comment": "Hey man!
